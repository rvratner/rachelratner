Description: Contracted with Plexipixel to build a localized animation-heavy site based on story boards.

Technology: HTML5, CSS3, SASS, JavaScript

Outcome:

Inflexible CMS: The website was based on a preexisting HTML template, which could not be deviated from, even though the layout was vastly different than the previous version. It was necessary to relayout page elements with CSS and JavaScript.
Backwards Compatible: It was required that this site be compatible both with modern browsers and Internet Explorer 7. To do this, I build the site to degrade gracefully, offering the full CSS3 animation experience in modern browser, and a more simplistic jQuery animation for older browsers.
Improved Latency:  This was a very image-heavy design, so it was necessary to optimize and pre-load all images to improve latency.
