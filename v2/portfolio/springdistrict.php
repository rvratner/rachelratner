Description: Contracted with Hey, Advertising to rebuild an interactive map for newly developing Spring District in Bellevue Washington.

Technology: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Adobe Edge Framework

Outcome: 

Valid Code: The original map was built in Adobe Edge, which adds a lot of unneccisary and redundant code. After scoping out the project goals and the complex nature of the interactions, it was my recommendation to rebuild the animations from scratch using valid HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Responsive Design: The original map was designed with a fixed width but I made the case to build it responsibly to fit on a variety of different devices.
Improved Latency: The end result had decreased load time, increased latency and still remained within the allotted build time and budget.
